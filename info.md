# Half-Life VOX

Play Half-Life-style VOX announcements on Cast and other media players. Phrases are built from WAV clips (auto-fetched from [sourcesounds/hl1](https://github.com/sourcesounds/hl1)) and played via `media_player.play_media` or the `hl_vox.play_phrase` service.

## Installation

Install via HACS, then add a `hl_vox:` block to your `configuration.yaml` with at least one phrase definition. See the [README](https://github.com/chugunomi/ha-hl-vox#readme) for details.
